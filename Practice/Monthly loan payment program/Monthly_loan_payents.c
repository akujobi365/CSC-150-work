/* This program calculates how much the user pays monthly for a loan

You have saved $500 to use as a down payment on a car.
Before beginning your car shopping, you decide to write a program to help you figure out what your monthly payment will be,
given the carâ€™s purchase price, the monthly interest rate, and the time period over which you will pay back the loan.
The formula for calculating your payment is 
payment = (iP)/[1-(1+i)^(-n)]

 where 
P = principal (the amount you borrow) 
i = monthly interest rate ( 1/12 of the annual rate) 
n = total number of payments 
Your program should prompt the user for the purchase price,
the down payment,
the annual interest rate
and the total number of payments (usually 36, 48, or 60).
It should then display the amount borrowed and the monthly payment including a dollar sign and two decimal places
