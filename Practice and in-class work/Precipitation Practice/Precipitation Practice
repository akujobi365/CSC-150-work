    This data was fetched from the historic data from weatherwx.com. [Brookings SD Climate Averages, Monthly Weather Conditions (weatherwx.com)](https://www.weatherwx.com/climate-averages/sd/brookings.html)
    
    This is all except for Dec 22, in which the value of 0.41 was used to ensure complete data
    
- Part 0
    - Open the file and read
    - Create 3 arrays containing the values of each year
        - E.g `Y2022[ ]` can contain the values for the year 2022
    - Print the contents to the screen
- Part1
    - Calculate the mean for each month for the 3 years
        - E.g Mean of Jan = (Jan22 + Jan21 + Jan20) / 3.0
    - Calculate the total rainfall for each year
    - Find the month with the highest rainfall for each year and the amount of rainfall
    - Find the month with the least rainfall for each year and the amount of rainfall
    - Print to a report file “Precipitation analytics.txt” and to the terminal
        - In a table, print
            - Headers: “Month    2022    2021    2020   Mean”
            - Monthly average precipitation
            - Mean for each month for the past 3 years
            - Total rainfall for each year
        - Below the table, print
            - The month with the highest rainfall for each year and the amount of rainfall
            - The month with the least rainfall for each year and the amount of rainfall
            
- Part 2
    - Bubble Sort the numbers for the years and print using the example below
        - Sorted 2022 = {num1, num2, num3….}
        - Sorted 2021 = {num1, num2, num3….}
        - Sorted 2020 = {num1, num2, num3….}
    - Find the median numbers in the years using the example below
        - Median number for 2022 is ###
        - Median number for 2022 is ###
        - Median number for 2022 is ###
        
- Part 3
    - Ask the user for 12 numbers between 5 and 10 and store them in an array (e.g UserN [12])
        - Make sure that the numbers are
    - Create an array Y22UserN which is the multiple of UserN[12] and the integer version of Y2022[ ]
        - This means each value in Y2022[ ] will multiply with its corresponding value in UserN[12]
        - E.g Y22UserN[ 1 ] = Y2022[ 1 ] * UserN[ 1 ]
    - Sort the array Y22UserN and find its mode
    - Print to the terminal, the values of
        - UserN[ ]
        - Y2022[ ]
        - Y22UserN[ ]
    - Print the mode of Y22UserN[ ]
    - Print the histogram of the valuesin Y22UserN[ ]
