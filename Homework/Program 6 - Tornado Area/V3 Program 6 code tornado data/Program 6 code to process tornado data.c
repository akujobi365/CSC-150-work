/*
Write a program to read the tornado.txt file and create a report.
Store the tornado report in a file named report.txt.

The tornado data contains
- The Fujita scale
- The tornado path length in miles
- The tornado path width in yards
These data are in columns

The report should contain the following data for each part, printed in columns:
EF rating
Path Length (miles)
Path Width (yards)
Affected Area (sq miles)
Below the part table, print the total area affected.

Data Storage (Defined in Main)
File *infile_tornado
- The Input tornado.txt file

File *outfile_report
- The Output Report.txt file

int fujita_scale
- first data on each line
- has to be between 0 - 6

float path_length_miles
- Path length of the tornado

float path_width_yards
- path_width of the tornado in yards

float affected_area
- calculated area affected by each tornado

float running_total
- the running total of the affected area



Functions (for each function, give the functionâ€™s prototype and 1 or 2 lines describing how the function works.)
1.	void Welcome ();
        Prints a welcome statements and tells the user the purpose of the program

2.	int Open_File (File *infile_tornado);
        Opens the tornado file and reads from it
        Prints error or success message to the terminal
        Returns 404 if unsuccessful
3.	int Get_Data (File *infile_tornado, int *fujita_scale, float *path_length_miles, int *path_width_yards);
        It reads a line of data from the tornado.txt
        Stores them into the pointers
        Uses a local variable [data_fetched]
4.	void Calc_Area (float *affected_area, float *path_length_miles, int *path_width_yards);
        Calculates the area affected for each tornado and keeps a running total of the areas
        Uses the formula [path_width_miles * path_length_yards /1760]
            Divided by 1760 to convert the yards to miles
5.	int Open_OutFile (File *outfile_report);
        Creates/ Opens the Repot.txt file
        Tells the terminal if file is successfully opened or not
        Returns 404 if unsuccessful

6.	int Print_Line (File *outfile_report, int *fujita_scale, float *path_length_miles, int *path_width_yards, float *affected_area););
        Prints one line into the report file

7.	void Print_Report (File *outfile_report, float *running_total);
        Prints all the lines to the report and then prints the total area affected
        While Get_Data ==1,
        it uses Calc_Area to calculate the area
        then calls Print_Line to print the information to the file
        After this loop ends, it prints the Total Area to the file using variable running_total
        Then prints a success message to the terminal
        Prints each line to the terminal to let user know the progress

8.	void End_Program  (File *infile_tornado, File *outfile_report);
        Closes the files
        Prints a success message to the terminal
